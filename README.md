My personal configuration files for MacOS

This includes files for configuring:
- Fish shell
- Neovim
- Tmux
- Hyper.js Terminal
- Alacritty Terminal

If you like them just clone and run './setup.sh', keep in mind this will install/update several utilities
and dependencies such as Node.js, Homebrew, rbenv, git, fish shell, tmux, yarn, hyper.js, etc.
